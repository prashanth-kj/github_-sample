1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
------------------------------------------------------

       HTTP:
       ----
         * HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. 
	 * It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
	 * By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.
	 
           ---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
	                HTTP1.1                               |                   HTTP2 
           ---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------					   
	  	                                              |
         *   HTTP1.1 was created in 1997.	              | *  HTTP2 was created in 2015.
	                                                      |
	 *   It works on the textual format.	              | *  It works on the binary protocol.
	                                                      |
	 *   HTTP1.1 is slower than HTTP2                     | *  HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. 
	                                                      |
	 *   There is head of line blocking that blocks       | *  It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection 
             all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get  |    is required for multiple request.
             its all resources.                               |                            
		                                              |
	 *   It uses requests resource Inlining for use       | *  It uses PUSH frame by server that collects  
	     getting multiple pages.                          |    all multiple pages.
		                                              |
	 *  Expands on the caching support by using           | *  It is does not change much in terms of caching.
            additional headers like cache-control.	      |
		   					      |
	 *   It compresses data by itself.	              | *  It uses HPACK for data compression.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Object in JavaScript:
  --------------------- 
      * In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.
  
      * Objects in programming can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
	  
      * Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
	  
      *	A JavaScript object is a collection of named values.
	  
      * Object values are written as  key : value pairs inside curly braces {}.
	  
      * an example of a JavaScript Object:
        ----------------------------------
	    
		   let myCup = {color: "transparent", volume: 1, weight: 0.5}
	 
      	      
			   variablename -> mycup ;
			          key   -> color, volume , weight ;
					  value -> "transparent" , 1 , 0.5 ;
					  
			 
		    if i called method -> console.log(myCup) = {color: "transparent", volume: 1, weight: 0.5}
			
	  *  finally  objects are adding and also change the values.
